# Feedback form 

This feedback form has been created to gain a deeper understanding of users' experiences with the PRE-for-CEM website. The website aims to enhance the preparation of international (and local) students aspiring to study Civil Engineering. Therefore, your feedback is invaluable in shaping its improvement for the benefit of future students.

There is a section made on feedback for the Open Educational Resources and for General feedback. 
If you have feedback on multiple topics you can fill in the feedback form multiple times.

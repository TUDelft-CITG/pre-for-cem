# 10 tips for incoming MSc students

1. Enjoy life

Don't forget to enjoy life and enjoy the place you are living in. Studying is not everything and it's hard to not study 24/7 at TU Delft.

2. Housing

Find housing as early as possible and get here a month in advance to get settled.

3. Expectations and programming

Prepare for an increasing workload and familiarize early with programming languages Python or MATLAB.

4. Time-management

Start planning early (your course, internships, thesis...), and just focus on a good time-management. Also, considering the very fast pace of the quarters and the lack of actual breaks, one needs to make sure to give themselves breaks to avoid burnout.

5. Prior knowledge

Students who will study in Delft should really prepare for the master programme.

6. Socialize

Try to connect with your fellow students at the beginning of you study program and take it easy at the start to get used to how things work here.

7. Planning

The courses are difficult so if possible, donâ€™t take on more ECTs than recommended/expected by the university.

8. Preparation

Hard work starts from day 1! It could be hard to focus in Uni at first while you are trying to settle in and figure out practical matters, but quarters are really short and if you fall behind it can be hard to catch up at last minute.

9. Study culture

The dutch studying culture is different than in other countries and it's better to adjust to it as soon as possible.

10. Confidence

Be confident about yourself with the uncertainties.

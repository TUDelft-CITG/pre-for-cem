# Mechanics

The following topics on **mechanics** are considered prerequisite knowledge for the civil engineering MSc-program:

Although the OER for mechanics is sufficient, it is difficult to find sources that 100% fit the bachelor program. Students who want more insight can buy the following books, which are also recommended for the bachelor program: 

- Engineering Mechanics: Volume 1: Equilibrium, C. Hartsuijker, H.J. Welleman, ISBN-13 978-1-4020-4120-4 (HB) or ISBN-10 1-4020-5483-1 (e-book)  
- Engineering Mechanics Volume 2: Stresses, Strains, Displacements, C. Hartsuijker, H.J. Welleman, ISBN 978-1-4020-4123-5 (HB) or ISBN 978-1-4020-5763-2 (e-book)

[^1]: This is an experimental Jupyter Book, part of an educational research project, made by staff and MSc students of TU Delft. The first three columns with required prior knowledge were defined by the admission committee Civil Engineering. The final column with Open Educational Resources (OER) is experimental. This OER materials are provided as a service. Although we did our best to collect OER that reflect the required knowledge as good as possible, based on surveys among students and discussion with staff members, unfortunately we can not give a guarantee that the quality of all material is good.

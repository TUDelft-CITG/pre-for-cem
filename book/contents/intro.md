# Education Day November 2023 Assignment introduction

Welcome to the PRE-for-CEM initiative within the Civil Engineering department. We're dedicated to building an open educational platform for incoming international students. Now, your chance has arrived to craft a mini open educational platform for your faculty. This assignment empowers you to enhance the inclusivity and accessibility of learning for your peers. Join us in shaping the future of education through the PRE-for-CEM project.

## Assignment for participants with a teaching role

- What are the admission criteria for the course or program that you’re teaching in?
- What are the learning objectives that are linked to the admission criteria? (perhaps select one subject or topic)
- Find an “open educational resource” that belongs to the learning objective that you found. 

## Assignment for participants with a support role 

- What are the admission criteria for the master programs of your faculty?
- How clear is it for applying students what prior knowledge is needed to enter the master? 
- If there was an open educational platform built to prepare international students better for the master, how would you promote this platform to the incoming students?

[^1]: This is an experimental Jupyter Book, part of an educational research project, made by staff and MSc students of TU Delft. The first two columns with required prior knowledge were defined by the admission committee Civil Engineering. Column 3 and 4 with Open Educational Resources (OER) is experimental. These OER materials are provided as a service. Although we did our best to collect OER that reflect the required knowledge as good as possible, based on surveys among students and discussion with staff members, unfortunately we can not give a guarantee that the quality of all material is good.

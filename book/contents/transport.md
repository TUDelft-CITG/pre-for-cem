# Transport & traffic

The following topics on **transport** are considered prerequisite knowledge for the civil engineering MSc-program.

Although the OER hereby mentioned are sufficient, it is difficult to find sources that entirely fit the bachelor program. Students who want more insight can buy the following book, which is also recommended for the bachelor program:  Garber, N.J., Hoel, L. A. (2009).Traffic & Highway Engineering. CENGAGE Learning

[^1]: This is an experimental Jupyter Book, part of an educational research project, made by staff and MSc students of TU Delft. The first two columns with required prior knowledge were defined by the admission committee Civil Engineering. Column 3 and 4 with Open Educational Resources (OER) is experimental. These OER materials are provided as a service. Although we did our best to collect OER that reflect the required knowledge as good as possible, based on surveys among students and discussion with staff members, unfortunately we can not give a guarantee that the quality of all material is good.

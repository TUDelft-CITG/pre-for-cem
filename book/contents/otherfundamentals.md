# Other fundamentals

Some fundamentals that are expected as prior knowledge are:
* High school physics:
   * Elements (atoms, protons, neutrons, electrons)
   * Waves (the phenomenon of waves in light, sound, air, fluids), wavelengths, frequencies, vibrations
   * Motion and interaction, kinetic energy, gravity, springs, laws of Newton
   * Electricity, fields, magnetism
   * Radiation, matter, photons
   * First understanding of implication of quantum mechanics and relativity
   * Laws of nature, models, experiments

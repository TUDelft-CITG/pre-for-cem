# Programming

Programming is an important skill that will directly be used in the first two quarters of the MSc Programme. At our Faculty, Python is the language used most, rather than Matlab or other languages. The reason for this is a.o. Python's broad applicability and the fact that is is powerful and free. Below, you can find access to a quick introductory course. This python course is accessible for free. It will also help you build a solid foundation in programming that will benefit you throughout your academic and professional career.

### How to take the course

Start the course by reading the Introduction part. Then get started with the Theory and Exercises under the <i>Course Contents</i>! In particular, the Python Toolbox Chapter describes how you can run Python code to solve the exercises. The last part of this course is called In a Nutshell; these are very concise recaps of the content from the main chapters in Course Contents. The idea is that you use these as a quick reference and review of the concepts, before and after the course.

[^1]: This is an experimental Jupyter Book, part of an educational research project, made by staff and MSc students of TU Delft. The first two columns with required prior knowledge were defined by the admission committee Civil Engineering. Column 3 and 4 with Open Educational Resources (OER) is experimental. These OER materials are provided as a service. Although we did our best to collect OER that reflect the required knowledge as good as possible, based on surveys among students and discussion with staff members, unfortunately we can not give a guarantee that the quality of all material is good.

## Disclaimer
This is an experimental Jupyter Book, part of an educational research project. The first two columns with required prior knowledge were defined by the MSc Admission Committee Civil Engineering. The third column with Open Educational Resources (OER) is experimental and work in progress. These OER materials are provided as a service. Although we did our best to collect OER that reflect the required knowledge as good as possible, based on surveys among students and discussion with staff members, unfortunately we can not give a guarantee that the quality of all material is good. Suggestions are welcome via [email](mailto:h.r.schipper@tudelft.nl?subject=pre-for-cem-suggestions). Our plan is to add more and more reliable and high-quality OER in the coming years.

## Acknowledgement
The financial support for the PRE-for-CEM project and follow-up PRE-for-CEM 2 was provided through a first grant under the WSV-2 funding scheme and a second grant from  the Educational Management Team. Special thanks goes to Caspar Jungbacker, who set up the JupyterBook and GitHub repository to make this book and website possible. Dr. Michiel de Jong as coordinator Open Education of TU Delft Library has been very supportive throughout the project. Dr. Timon Idema, Dr. Robert Lanzafame and ing. Ronald Ligteringen have kindly introduced us to the wonders of Markdown and Jupyter Books. Also many professors of our faculty have been supportive of the idea and have spent their valuable time in reviewing the OER.

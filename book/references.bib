  abstract  = {The shear strength characteristics of fresh concrete were studied through the use of a triaxial compression apparatus on concrete cylinders 100 mm in diameter and 200 mm high at 21°C and 4°C for set times ranging from 40 minutes to 160 minutes. The test results were analyzed by the shear strength theories of Mohr-Coulomb and Rowe for each time-temperature combination. The angle of internal friction was found to be a constant property of the mix in the range of 37° to 41° for a 10% failure strain when analyzed by Mohr-Coulomb. Rowe's analysis gave friction angles of 18° to 21° for a 10% failure strain. Both theories indicate that the cohesion of fresh concrete is initially zero and increases with set time.},
